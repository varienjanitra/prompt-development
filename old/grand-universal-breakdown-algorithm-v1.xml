        [Phase 1. Reduction of {{topic}} - Reductionist Analysis]
            1. Breakdown the {{topic}} into the @primordial_axioms that allows the {{topic}} to exist, to find the 'non-negotiable truths'
                1.1. Identify the {{topic}} domain, is it a deterministic system or a probabilistic system? 
                1.1.1. Check whether the system has @sensitivity to @initial_conditions (chaos theory). Some systems look deterministic but behave like they're probabilistic (like weather). 
                1.1.2. Check for ergodicity, whether it is an ensemble or time averages, and path dependency
                1.1.3. Chekc the temporal domain of the {{topic}}: (e.g., A mountain is a "Thing" in human time, but a "Fluid" in geologic time)
                1.2. Remove the context of the {{topic}} (e.g., If the {{topic}} is "The Stock Market," remove "Money"; you are left with "Resource Allocation").
                1.2.1. Check for "Substrate Independence" (e.g., Can Economics exist in a digital simulation? Yes. Can it exist without Time? No.) to identify @absolute_minimum_primitives
                1.3. Check for whether there is any @observer_bias or @contextual_framing
                1.4. Identify the "Domain of Validity" and  whether it is also self-similar: At what scale does this {{topic}} cease to be true? (e.g., Classical Mechanics breaks at the quantum scale; Economics breaks at the scale of a 2-person household).
                1.5. Check for "Fat Tails" (Black Swan events).
                1.99. Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem. Every formal system sufficiently complex will have truths that cannot be proven within the system itself.
            2. Identify the @primitives, what are the smallest units of the {{topic}}
            3. Find the axiomatic floor/@primordial axioms, what must be true for these units/@primitives to exists?
        [Phase 2. Emergence of {{topic}} - Structural Synthesis]
            4. Define the ontological rules, how do these @primitives interact (@interaction)?
            5. Identify the @taxonomy, how to we group these @interaction?
            5.1. Hegelian Synthesis: Check for Internal Contradictions, oftem a system (e.g. Economics) exists specifically to manage two contradictory axioms (e.g., "Infinite Growth" vs "Finite Resources").
            6. Map the @system, look for feedback loops, entropy, and equilibrium. This is where the {{topic}} lives.
            6.1. Map out the @emergences: identify the @system_properties that the @system has, which the individual units/@primitives do not (e.g. "Liquidity" in markets, "consciousness" in brains)
            6.1.1. Check for "Qualia Gap", check for @Phenomenology: whether the system produces an internal subjective state that cannot be fully captured by the structural map.
            6.2. Check whether the @emergence is weak (predictable) or strong (novel) or is there any downward causation?
            6.3. Check whether the @system is self referential: (e.g. In Economics, if everyone believes a crash is coming, the crash happens. The observer is inside the system. We could call this @reflexivity.)
            6.4. Landauer's Principle: What is the thermodynamic cost of the @system? (e.g. Even a thought in the English Language costs glucose!)
        [Phase 3. Abstraction of {{topic}} - Categorical Abstraction]
            7. Turn the @system into a set of inputs and outputs
            8. Perform isomorphic search to find the @morphisms, find @other_topics with the same "shape" (e.g. "A viral tweet spreads like a biological pathogen")
            8.1. Distinguish between the analogy and Isomorphism of the {{topic}} and the @other_topics
            9. Strip away context of @system until you are left with category theory. Map the @morphisms and the @adjoint_functors (e.g. In Economics, "Supply" and "Demand" are adjoints. In Language, "Speaking" (Encoding) and "Hearing" (Decoding) are adjoints. It's the "balance" or "equilibrium" expressed in pure math.)
            9.1. Look for Conservatioin Laws: In Physics, it's Energy; in Economics, it's Value; in Language, it's "Meaning." What is the one thing the system refuses to lose?
            10. You have reached the absolute abstraction.

    <core-algorithm-example>
        Take the {{topic}} of {{English Language}}:
            * [1. Axiomatic] -> Primordial Axioms: The existence of "Difference." (For a sound to mean something, it must be "not-another-sound"). The Law of Identity.
            * [2. Physical] -> Physical/Medium: Sound waves (vibrations in air) or photons (ink on paper). The biological capacity for pattern recognition.
            * [3. Relational] -> Ontological Rules: Grammar and Syntax. "Subject-Verb-Object." The rule that links a "Sound" to a "Concept."
            * [4. The {{topic}}]: English (Level 4): The specific vocabulary, the "General UK" vibe, the slang, the history.
            * [5. Abstract] -> Information Theory: The "Entropy" of language. How much data can I remove before you stop understanding me? (e.g., "U ok hun?").
            * [6. Structural] -> Structural Patterns: Language as an Evolutionary System. It behaves exactly like DNA—mutating, replicating, and competing for survival.
            * [7. Absolute Abstraction] -> Absolute Abstraction: A Mapping of Semantics. In the Topos, Language is just a "Functor" between a set of "Symbols" and a set of "Meanings."
