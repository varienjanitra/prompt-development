    <core-algorithm>
        [Phase 1. The Substrate (Reduction)]
            1. <axiom-extraction> 
                **The Bedrock.** 
                - Identify the @primordial_axioms (The logical truths necessary for existence).
                - *Gödel’s Check:* Identify a truth within this system that is true but unprovable by the system's own rules.
            </axiom-extraction>
            
            2. <physical-basis>
                **The Hardware.** 
                - *Thermodynamics:* Apply Landauer's Principle. What is the metabolic or energetic cost to maintain this state against entropy?
                - *Substrate Independence:* Can this algorithm run on different hardware? (e.g. Can "Markets" exist without "Humans"?).
            </physical-basis>
            
            3. <boundary-definition>
                **The Scope.**
                - *Via Negativa:* Define the **Anti-{{topic}}**. What specific condition instantly annihilates this topic?
                - *Domain of Validity:* At what scale (Quantum, Newtonian, Relativistic, Complexity) does this model fail?
            </boundary-definition>

        [Phase 2. The Dynamics (Emergence)]
            4. <interaction-mapping>
                **The Rules.** 
                - *Ergodicity:* Is the system Ergodic (Time average = Ensemble average) or Path-Dependent (History matters)?
                - *Chaos:* Is there @sensitivity_to_initial_conditions?
            </interaction-mapping>
            
            5. <teleology-and-utility>
                **The Driver.**
                - *Objective Function:* What variable is the system maximizing?
                - *Hegelian Tension:* Identify the Thesis and Antithesis driving the system's internal conflict.
            </teleology-and-utility>
            
            6. <reflexivity-check>
                **The Loop.**
                - *Observer Effect:* Does the act of modeling this topic alter the topic itself? (Soros' Reflexivity).
                - *Qualia Gap:* Is there an internal subjective experience missing from the structural description?
            </teleology-and-utility>

        [Phase 3. The Abstraction (Isomorphism)]
            7. <information-theory>
                **The Code.**
                - *Kolmogorov Complexity:* Is the topic Compressible (Simple laws generate complex behavior) or Incompressible (Random)?
                - *Signal-to-Noise:* What is the redundancy requirement?
            </information-theory>
            
            8. <structural-isomorphism>
                **The Pattern.**
                - Map the *mechanism* of this topic to a completely different domain (e.g. Biology <-> Economics). 
                - *Constraint:* The mapping must be structural, not aesthetic.
            </structural-isomorphism>
            
            9. <category-theory-topos>
                **The Absolute.** (Strict Math Mode).
                - *Objects:* The fundamental dots.
                - *Morphisms:* The transformations between dots.
                - *Adjoint Functors:* The relationship that preserves structure across domains (Left/Right Adjoints).
                - *Identity:* What remains invariant?
